USE EVENT VIEWER Use Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc) can provide logs that might indicate what processes or scripts are being executed at logon.
===========================================================================================================================================================================================
    Security Logs
        These logs can provide information about login attempts, changes to security settings, and other security-related activities. Look for any unusual patterns or entries around the times you suspect Group Policy settings were modified.
    System Logs
        System logs contain events logged by the operating system components. These can include system errors, warnings, and informational events, some of which may be related to Group Policy changes.
    Application Logs
        These logs hold events logged by applications. If a specific application is responsible for modifying Group Policy settings, you might find relevant entries here.
    Group Policy Operational Logs
        Located under "Applications and Services Logs" -> "Microsoft" -> "Windows" -> "GroupPolicy" -> "Operational". This log specifically tracks Group Policy processing and can be very useful in identifying when and how Group Policy was applied or refreshed.
Event IDs to Look For
    Event ID 4688: A new process has been created (can help track execution of scripts or programs).
    Event ID 4738: A user account was changed (might indicate changes in user privileges or settings).
    Event ID 4720: A user account was created (useful if new accounts are being made for malicious purposes).
    Event ID 4704: A user right was assigned (can indicate changes in user rights, which could relate to Group Policy changes).

It is possible to detect GPO modifications by monitoring directory service changes using Windows event logs. Several events may be logged for such GPO modifications, including:
Event ID 5136 Event ID 5137 Event ID 5138 Event ID 5139 Event ID 5141

Check for streams in C drive with Nirsoft Alternate Stream Viewer : https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/alternate_data_streams.html
        To view stream content use the following command in powershell : Get-Content <filename> -Stream <streamname>

Clean up remaining things with autoruns : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns
AccessEnum and look for important registries
1. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

    Purpose: This key is used to launch programs automatically when a user logs in. Malware often adds entries here to achieve persistence.
    Check For: Unauthorized or suspicious entries that might indicate malware or unwanted software.

2. HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

    Purpose: Similar to the above, but specific to the current user.
    Check For: Unexpected entries that could be launching malware or unnecessary applications at login.

3. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services

    Purpose: Contains configurations for services that are run by the system.
    Check For: New or modified service entries, particularly those with unusual names or descriptions, as these can be indicative of rootkits or other stealthy malware types.

4. HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT*\shell\open\command

    Purpose: Determines actions taken when files are opened, often targeted to execute malware when certain files are opened.
    Check For: Modifications that do not align with known applications or system behaviors.

5. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

    Purpose: Manages Windows logon process. Attackers target this to manipulate user authentication processes.
    Check For: Unauthorized changes in keys like Userinit and Shell, which could redirect the logon process to malicious scripts or programs.

6. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System

    Purpose: Contains various system-level policies, including security settings.
    Check For: Changes that weaken security, like disabling the lock screen or UAC (User Account Control).

7. HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings

    Purpose: Manages Internet Explorer settings, including proxy configurations.
    Check For: Unexpected proxy settings that could redirect internet traffic through malicious servers.

8. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced\Folder\Hidden\SHOWALL

    Purpose: Controls the visibility of hidden files in Explorer.
    Check For: Changes that hide files from view, a common trick by malware to remain undetected.


ProcHacker replaces need for PsExec(you can also run as system) : https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/downloads.php

It's finally time to run that script huh.
Install GIT.(if broken just cop the directory download from: https://github.com/simeononsecurity/Standalone-Windows-STIG-Script/tree/master)
Hop into an elevated shell and navigate to the directory (possibly with system level access)
Do : Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force
Create users.txt file in .../CYPAT-main/Windows

        D
    }
Look at core services and ensure they are enabled in script. Do any last minute tweaks to ensure coverage.
Go through each module one by one.
Note any errors that occur.
Swiftly check that the following effects were changed.
    Logs are created in C:

FIX ANY PROBLEMS THAT OCCURED DURING SCRIPT
    apps didn’t update
    apps didn’t uninstall
    certain settings couldn’t apply
    couldn’t get logs
    user mishaps

Go into GPEDIT and import your firewall settings
Open up file logs alongside everything tools and go through. Scan for any weird extensions, file names, and promptly remove. Look for any remaining applications that evaded the initial scan.
        Open Everything: Launch the Everything application on your computer.
                Access Settings: Go to the Tools menu and select Options to open the settings dialog.
                Modify Index Settings:
                    Navigate to the Indexes section.
                    Look for options related to file attributes. Ensure that the Include hidden files and folders and Include system files and folders checkboxes are checked. This tells Everything to index hidden and system files.
                Rebuild Index:
                
                    After changing these settings, you might need to rebuild the index for the changes to take effect.
                    You can do this by going to the Tools menu and selecting Rebuild Index. Note that rebuilding the index might take some time, depending on the number of files on your system.
